# Geckoboard Weather Widget Data Feeder

hitting /weather will get the current weather information from the open
weather map API and return it in a format that can be used in a Geckoboard
Custom "Text" Widget.

There are 3 environment variables that need to be set for this to work:
* OPENWEATHERMAP\_API\_KEY
* WEATHER\_UNITS
* WEATHER\_SEARCH\_STRING

Deploy with one click. It will even prompt you for the environment variable
values. Neat!
